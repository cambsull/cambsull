## 🙌 You're here! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and to me coding is one of the best ways that I can contribute to the world and hopefully make life a little better for as many people as possible. I have enjoyed working with a number of technologies, but at my core I am a JavaScript and React enthusiast because they are flexible, powerful tools that can easily interface with front-end design work to create a great user experience that quickly meets the needs of the end user!

## ⚡ Quick info:

#### 🕹️ I recently released a JavaScript-based library for the Steam Web API as an NPM package, which has now been downloaded over 200 times! The [repo can be found here](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary), and the [NPM package is available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swalib).

#### 🐦 I also recently worked with a team of developers to [build a website](https://lewistoncbc.netlify.app) for a local chapter of the Audubon Society, enabling the 61,000 residents of that area to easily connect with their local organization!

#### 📚 I'm working on a thorough [series of notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYbfrk1qRBY3FRNpe1NPU4l5CYZhV4KgDGI5FhcMSmc/edit) based on [Lane Wagner's](https://github.com/wagslane) excellent course on obtaining a job in software development. After finishing and editing these notes, I will host them right here on GitHub to use as a reference guide for new developers and current job-seekers!

#### 🎤 Fun fact: I've been researching and writing a book about the history of my favorite genre of music, *Nerdcore*, which is a branch of hip-hop thematically centered around topics of interest to nerds and geeks.
