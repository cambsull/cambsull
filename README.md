## 🙌 You're here! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and I've been coding in some capacity or another since I was a little kid writing "Choose Your Own Adventure" programs in QBASIC on a PC that took ten full minutes to boot to Windows. To me, coding is one of the
best ways that I can contribute to the world and hopefully make life a little better for as many people as possible. I have enjoyed working with a number of technologies, but at my core I am a JavaScript and React enthusiast because they
are flexible, powerful tools that can easily interface with front-end design work to create a great user experience that quickly meets the needs of the end user!

## ⚡ Quick info:

#### 🕹️ I recently wrote a cool JavaScript [Steam Web API Wrapper Library](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary) that makes it easy to work with the Steam Web API. I'm using it in another Steam-related project, coming soon!

#### 🐦 I also recently [built a website](https://lewistoncbc.netlify.app) for a local chapter of the Audubon Society, enabling the 61,000 residents of that area to easily connect with their local organization!

#### ✉️ The best way to reach me is [through my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cambria-sullivan-ab3647a6/).

#### 🎤 Fun fact: I've been researching and writing a book about the history of my favorite genre of music, *Nerdcore*, which is a branch of hip-hop thematically centered around topics of interest to nerds and geeks.
