## Hello! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, a full-stack engineer based out of Washington state. I am currently working for Inland Cellular, a telecommunications company, helping to develop their internal tooling and client websites!

If you want to talk, the best way to reach me is [through my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cambria-sullivan).

## My story: 

In the summer of 2023, I decided to change my career trajectory. I have always been interested in computing and dabbled in programming throughout my life, but after finding myself unfulfilled in a management role for a local government organization, I decided it was time to really make a change. Although my bachelor's degree is in anthropology, I dedicated myself to becoming a professional software developer and spent the second half of 2023 teaching myself how to code, design, and think like a programmer. Codecademy was my platform of choice, and they even wrote a [feature about me](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/from-management-to-freelance-web-developer) after I completed my coursework.

In May of 2024, I started doing contract work for a startup called [Aquifer PE](https://aquiferpe.com). What started as pitching in on a few small coding tasks eventually grew to me being responsible for designing and building the entire front-end! It was the first time that my skills were put to the test in a real-world environment where real people had invested their time, energy, and money into a product. I'm very happy to say that as of February 2026, Aquifer PE is still gaining steam and onboarding new users!

In the summer of 2025, a friend from back home had a need for another engineer in his department. He put my name in for consideration, and after a couple of weeks spent checking my phone every three minutes to see if I had an email, I got an interview request! My friend had seen my progress from the very first basics of HTML all the way up through my work with Aquifer PE, and between his heartfelt recommendation and my interview performance, I finally achieved my dream of getting a full-time job in tech!

I love my work and can't imagine doing anything else. To me, there's nothing like software engineering to offer that particular blend of research, problem-solving, tinkering, and just plain fun.

## The other stuff: 

#### Recently (as of 2026), I have taken an interest in Godot 4, and in my spare time I like to tinker, program, and build games with that engine.

#### I released a JavaScript-based library for the Steam Web API as an NPM package, which has now been downloaded over 700 times! The [repo can be found here](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary), and the [NPM package is available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swalib).

#### I also enjoy chess, playing guitar, weight lifting, and hiking.
