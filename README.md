## üôå You're here! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and I've been coding in some capacity or another since I was a little kid writing "Choose Your Own Adventure" programs in QBASIC on a PC that took ten full minutes to boot to Windows. To me, coding is one of the
best ways that I can contribute to the world and hopefully make life a little better for as many people as possible. I have enjoyed working with a number of technologies, but at my core I am a JavaScript and React enthusiast because they
are flexible, powerful tools that can easily interface with front-end design work to create a great user experience that quickly meets the needs of the end user!

## ‚ö° Quick info:

#### üïπÔ∏è I'm collaborating on a team developing a cool JavaScript [Steam Web API Wrapper Library](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary) that makes it easy to work with the Steam Web API. I'll be using it in another Steam-related project, coming soon!

#### üê¶ I also recently [built a website](https://lewistoncbc.netlify.app) for a local chapter of the Audubon Society, enabling the 61,000 residents of that area to easily connect with their local organization!

#### üìö I'm working on a thorough [series of notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYbfrk1qRBY3FRNpe1NPU4l5CYZhV4KgDGI5FhcMSmc/edit) based on [Lane Wagner's](https://github.com/wagslane) excellent course on obtaining a job in software development. After finishing and editing these notes, I will host them right here on GitHub to use as a reference guide for new developers and current job-seekers!

#### ‚úâÔ∏è The best way to reach me is [through my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cambria-sullivan-ab3647a6/).

#### üé§ Fun fact: I've been researching and writing a book about the history of my favorite genre of music, *Nerdcore*, which is a branch of hip-hop thematically centered around topics of interest to nerds and geeks.
