## üôå Hello! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and to me coding is one of the best ways that I can contribute to the world and hopefully make life a little better for people. I am currently contracted with [Aquifer PE](https://www.aquiferpe.com/), where we are building a recruitment platform and job board focused on the professional engineering sector.

‚úâÔ∏è The best way to reach me is [through my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cambria-sullivan).

## ‚ö° Cool stuff:

#### üïπÔ∏è I released a JavaScript-based library for the Steam Web API as an NPM package, which has now been downloaded over 600 times! The [repo can be found here](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary), and the [NPM package is available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swalib).

#### ‚ú®In my spare time I like to work on Glimmer List (working title), an app using React Native and Xano. Glimmer List allows you to collect and reflect on things that you value-- treasured memories, favorite TV shows or movies, or anything else that brings you joy! You can also upload photos and write reflections on your collection of glimmers. I'm building this app because I believe that being able to effortlessly access, reflect on, and engage with things that are important to an individual can do a lot to improve someone's day, or even their life. I hope to publish Glimmer List through Google Play by Q1 2026!
