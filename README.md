## 🙌 You're here! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and I've been coding in some capacity or another since I was a little kid writing "Choose Your Own Adventure" programs in QBASIC on a PC that took ten full minutes to boot to Windows.

## ⚡ Quick info:

#### 👩‍💻 I'm currently working on an app to modernize the software used by a utility contractor company with hundreds of clients that serve thousands of people.

#### 🐦 I recently [built a website](https://lewistoncbc.netlify.app) for a local chapter of the Audubon Society, enabling the 61,000 residents of that area to easily connect with their local organization!

#### ✉️ The best way to reach me is [through my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cambria-sullivan-ab3647a6/).

#### 🎤 Fun fact: I've been researching and writing a book about the history of my favorite genre of music, *Nerdcore*, which is a branch of hip-hop thematically centered around topics of interest to nerds and geeks.
