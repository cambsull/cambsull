## 🙌 You're here! 

I am Cambria Sullivan, and to me coding is one of the best ways that I can contribute to the world and hopefully make life a little better for people. I am currently contracting for a company that is building a recruitment platform and job board focused on the professional engineering sector. I have also recently taken an interest in cybersecurity and have been learning about the world of pen testing, using nmap, and how to keep the applications I build updated and secure!

## ⚡ Quick info:

#### 🕹️ I released a JavaScript-based library for the Steam Web API as an NPM package, which has now been downloaded over 250 times! The [repo can be found here](https://github.com/cambsull/SteamWebAPILibrary), and the [NPM package is available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swalib).

#### 🐦 I also worked with a team of developers to [build a website](https://lewistoncbc.netlify.app) for a local chapter of the Audubon Society, enabling the 61,000 residents of that area to easily connect with their local organization!

#### 👩‍🍳 I recently started [building an app that uses the Edamam API](https://github.com/cambsull/Recipe-Complexity-Optimizer) to search for recipes, and then sorts them based on an algorithm that takes into account the type of dish, the total number of ingredients, and the total preparation time. This app is designed for neurodivergent people who want to be able to quickly locate recipes based on their relative complexity and time needed to cook them!
